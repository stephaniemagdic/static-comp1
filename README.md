# Static Comp Challenge # 1 
(Note to self: link deployed site)

#### [Static Comp Challenge 1 Spec](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-1/m1-static-comp)

## Project Description: 

The static `coffeefinder` page was built using the provided static comp below. HTML/CSS muscles were flexed and a splash of creativity was added to reimagine the page, now using the cards to display information for various coffee shops near you! (Say hi to mom on card 7!) 

* This project was built with a normalize.css file
* Miro wireframes were created before writing any code considering mobile first design and working towards the desktop, making design decisions based on key UX/UI priciples.
* Web accessibility was evaluated with [WAVE chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/wave-evaluation-tool/jbbplnpkjmmeebjpijfedlgcdilocofh?hl=en-US): 0 errors found.

Future Itterations: 
This site is not functional, as it is a purely CSS/HTML repository. In the future I would love to add JavaScript to make the coffee finder dream come true.
